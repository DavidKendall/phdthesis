                  automata. Gives a semantics both in terms of timed
                  automata and directly as timed transition
                  system. Defines timed bisimulation and shows that
                  the transition system induced by the direct
                  semantics of a term is timed bisimilar to the
                  transition system of the timed automaton derived
                  from the term. Gives an axiomatisation. Also
                  contains an example of an ACP process with
                  integration which requires the addition of clock
                  comparisons to timed automata to allow a
                  translation. Timed automata with clock comparisons
                  are not decidable.}

                  speech is autonomous, but hearing takes place only
                  when the environment speaks. This paper develops a
                  timed CBS (TCBS) where no time may pass if there is
                  speech pending. A process wishing to speak can be
                  forced, by attaching a time-out to it, to first
                  listen for a specified length of time. Those forced
                  to wait for a long time can be seen as having low
                  priority. This reading is consistent with PCBS,
                  which is CBS with priorities. TCBS has an expansion
                  theorem even if time is dense. A delay prefix
                  operator can be derived up to weak bisimulation if
                  time dependent behaviour is allowed. TCBS casts, by
                  contrast, light on handshake communication: on time
                  abstracted bisimulation, and on the relations
                  between time and priority, between expansion
                  theorems and density of time, and between delays and
                  time-outs. }
