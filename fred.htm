	<TD>
        CANDLE is a high-level programming language and development environment
        for control systems implemented using the Controller Area Network (CAN)
        communication protocol. It is designed to integrate the production of
        a CAN system implementation and its formal model. CAN provides
        multi-master, priority-based bus access based on a CSMA/CR protocol
        whose deterministic collision resolution policy makes it suitable for
        use in hard real-time systems. Use of CAN is widespread in the
        automotive industry and in other sectors where the requirement for
        high assurance systems provides a strong incentive for the application
        of formal development methods.
        <BR> <BR>

        A CANDLE program consists of a high-level description of the behaviour
        of system processes and the structure of the network via which they
        communicate. The control of a system model is represented as a timed
        Petri net, derived automatically by translation from the CANDLE
        program, which has the advantage of giving a compact representation of
        the control aspects of the system.
        <BR> <BR>

        In previous approaches, this Petri net was translated into a
        timed automaton and analysed using existing model checkers (e.g.,
        KRONOS). However, these approaches suffer from a number of
        disadvantages, the most serious being that they allow the
        generation of redundant locations and edges and can produce
        extremely large timed automata. In the current approach, the
        Petri net is translated into a simulation graph, in which time
        information is represented using clock zones.  <BR> <BR>

        The simulation graph is represented by a C program implementing the 
        OPEN/CAESAR graph API, which is automatically generated from the timed
        Petri net. This program provides functions for generating the initial
        simulation graph node and iterating over the simulation graph
        successors of a node. This program also implements on the fly the
        well-known clock activity abstraction technique.
        <BR> <BR>

        The simulation graphs of a number of examples have been generated. In
        each case, the simulation graph with clock activity reduction is
        several orders of magnitude smaller that the corresponding timed
        automaton. In one case, it was not even possible to generate the
        timed automaton, whereas the simulation graph with clock activity
        reduction was easily generated.

	<TH ALIGN=left VALIGN=top>Conclusions:</TH>
	
	<TD>
        The general approach of translation from a high-level language through
        a number of intermediate stages to C source code implementing the
        OPEN/CAESAR API has proved to lead to an effective decomposition of the
        translation problem, providing opportunities for optimisation at every
        stage and resulting in programs which can be connected easily with a
        variety of analysis tools. This approach clearly outperforms methods in
        which a timed automaton is constructed explicitly.
